    description: `This course helped me to finally understand and dominate modern React.js, as itâ€™s in a 100% built  focusing on React hooks and functional components. It also had sections on unit and integration tests in each application that I did in the course, this includes tests on components, hooks, customHooks, context, Redux, Fetch, mocks, spies, snapshots and much more related to the unit test. It also gave me the necessary knowledge to be a FullStack Developer using React.js and Node.js on the Backend along with MongoDB and Firestore as databases.`,
