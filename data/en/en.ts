        choice: `Since my father is a retired Systems Analyst, I've had a close relationship with computers since I was a little child. As I grew up I started to notice how much potential computers and specially software had, watching my dad speed up regular tasks as writing notes or mailing using tools like Word / email clients (respectively). Firstly I was seduced by videogames, specially Age of Empires II (I wanted to see my home country Argentina be part of that game as a brand new civilization!). Then, robotics and automation called my attention as I saw robotic arms put cars and complex devices together using software and physics. Finally, I saw the lack of efficiency that businesses and state entities had because of the many tasks that they were performing manually (mostly paperwork), and I found myself thinking "This whole waiting line could dissapear if those paper forms could be filled online and sent by email or some platform!". That's when I knew that Software Engineering was my path!`,
        subjects: `I do like the ones where there's a huge project to build and the different topics this particular subject teaches you, help you solve difficulties that may appear along the way. In the other side of the highway, I definetly do not enjoy fully theoretical subjects. Not because I don't like reading theory, but because I truly believe those could be sum up in two or three classes and then, just videoconferences or YouTube videos! And leave more in-class time to practise and ask the teacher for advice.`,
        expectations: ` I expect to learn much more about the "human" part of the software industry. I want to learn how a company is built and what do I need to construct one, also I'd love to learn how software companies manage their teams and how are the dynamics like inside of a development team`,

It has also taught me that ideas are this abstract concept that, if worth spreading, it can turn many lives around.`,
